💭 Hi, I'm Sima.

✨ I have over 3 years of experience as a Business Analyst and QA Engineer. 

🔭 I am currently focused on enhancing my automation and performance testing skills, and I plan to start practicing AI testing.

🦄 I have a proven ability to be detail-oriented, efficient in test execution, and clear in documentation. I am capable of handling complex technical challenges and adapting to new technologies.

⚡ I truly enjoy testing and finding bugs. I'm a reliable bug catcher, which earned me the nickname: the last bug bender. 

☁️ I'm from Türkiye and have been living in Gdańsk, Poland since 2024.

🎓 I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering at Bilkent University.



🌻 More about me,

👻 In my free time, I mostly dive into long novels (finally got that focus back!) or unwind with shows, movies, and gaming.

📷 I looove taking pictures, and deeply appreciate aesthetics. Capturing the beauty of Poland’s nature and architecture has been such a rewarding experience since relocating here.

🌚 I enjoy writing blogs about tech and travel, and honestly, making detailed travel plans on Notion has been a total game changer for my trips. I also use it for recipes and pretty much whatever else I need.

🎧 When I’m not doing any of that, I’m probably curating my ever-growing Spotify playlists—they’re basically part of my personality.
